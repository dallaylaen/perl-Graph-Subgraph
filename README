Graph::Subgraph

This module allows to create subgraphs of a given Graph object
induced by a set (or two) of vertices.

A vertex of the original graph is copied if and only if it is in set1 OR set2.

An edge of the original graph is copied if and only if it starts in set1 and
ends in set2 (or set1 if set2 wasn't given).

It should be merged into Graph some day.
